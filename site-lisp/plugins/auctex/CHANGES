Changes and New Features in AUCTeX
**********************************

News in 12.3
============

   * Support for 'PSTricks' is now PDF-oriented.  AUCTeX no longer turns
     off PDF mode for 'PSTricks' documents even without 'pst-pdf'.  It
     now sets up 'TeX-PDF-from-DVI' option so that PDF output is
     generated when 'TeX-PDF-mode' is enabled (default).  Users who want
     DVI output should disable PDF mode explicitly by file local
     variable, or customize 'TeX-PDF-mode' to 'nil'.

   * The function 'font-latex-update-font-lock' has been obsoleted in
     order to fix 'bug#37945'.  That function was used by several style
     files in order to refresh fontification after adding new symbols or
     verbatim constructs.  It is better to call 'font-lock-flush' in the
     former case and 'font-latex-set-syntactic-keywords' in the latter
     case.  The function 'font-latex-update-font-lock' still exists as a
     no-op which only shows a warning explaining how to update font-lock
     as mentioned above.

   * Math expression highlighting was improved.  Highlighting for
     documents with a lot of inline math expressions '$...$' won't get
     scrambled now ('bug#33139').

     There is small incompatibility due to this fix.  When odd number of
     dollar signs are in a comment, the subsequent lines are highlighted
     as math until another '$' appears.  You can insert a commented
     dollar sign ('%$') at the next suitable end of line as a
     workaround.

     In addition, it is no longer recommended to customize
     'font-latex-math-environments'.  Use 'texmathp-tex-commands'
     instead.

   * AUCTeX tracks changes in LaTeX2e 2020-02-02 release.  AUCTeX
     supports the improvements to LaTeX font selection mechanism (NFSS).
     New macros like '\textsw' or '\textulc' are added to font insertion
     keyboard commands.  See the section for inserting font specifiers
     for details.  Further, the entries in the menu LaTeX, Insert Font
     are reorganized and adjusted accordingly.

     Macros previously provided by 'textcomp.sty' are now part of LaTeX
     kernel.  AUCTeX tracks this change as well and support for the new
     macro '\legacyoldstylenums' is added.

   * Insertion of environments in LaTeX documents (i.e.  'C-c C-e') was
     improved.  The former code had a few bugs, which sometimes resulted
     in either spurious empty line or spurious comment prefix, or both,
     especially when the region is active.  Those bugs are now fixed.

   * More bugs fixed, other minor features implemented.

News in 12.2
============

   * AUCTeX reflects the changes in LaTeX2e 2019-10-01 release.
     'filecontents' environment now takes an optional argument and can
     be used anywhere in a document.  The macros '\Ref' and
     '\labelformat' are moved from 'varioref.sty' to LaTeX kernel.
     amsmath has a new macro '\overunderset'.

   * A new method is implemented in preview-latex to adjust the
     foreground colors of generated images to those of Emacs, when the
     LaTeX command produces PDF.  The traditional method became invalid
     because of the change introduced in Ghostscript 9.27.
     Unfortunately, the new method doesn't work due to a bug in
     Ghostscript 9.27 and is valid only for Ghostscript > 9.27.  There
     is also a fallback method for gs 9.27 users which displays plain
     "black on white" images.  For successful function of preview-latex,
     the users are encouraged to set up the new user option
     'preview-pdf-color-adjust-method' to choose appropriate option
     among the three: new, traditional and fallback method.

   * AUCTeX has support for the Flymake package in Emacs 26 or newer.
     To enable, call 'M-x flymake-mode RET' or add this to your '.emacs'
     file:
          (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'flymake-mode)

   * The way the option 'TeX-record-buffer' is used was corrected.  It
     was used in just the opposite way as the document says.  Erase the
     customization if you have customized this option since it now acts
     in reverse to your expectation.

   * A former customize option 'japanese-TeX-command-list' is removed.
     Use 'japanese-TeX-engine-default', or if it's really necessary,
     customize 'TeX-command-list' directly if the task which the option
     used to carry is required.

   * Support for standard LaTeX without e-TeX extension is now very
     limited.  It doesn't work if raw TeX code is put on the command
     line to invoke latex command.  It also fails for region compilation
     ('C-c C-r' and so on) with documents of non-ascii file name.  In
     addition, it no longer works with preview-latex.  We consider this
     incompatibility is permissible because e-TeX extension is enabled
     for standard LaTeX by default long ago.  LaTeX variants such as
     XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX are not affected.

   * Key binds in Texinfo mode are improved.  Typing '$', '^', '_' and
     '\' now just self-inserts without pointless side effects in Texinfo
     mode.

     In addition, the option 'TeX-electric-escape' is now effective in
     Texinfo mode.  When it is enabled, typing '@' will invoke
     'TeX-electric-macro' offering completion in similar style with
     other TeX modes of AUCTeX.

   * Fontification support for 'biblatex' package is improved and
     updated to macros provided by package version 3.12.  For qualified
     lists, at least 2 mandatory arguments are fontified.

   * Support for column specifiers 'w' and 'W' provided by 'array'
     package is added to 'array.el'.  The correct counting of columns
     only works when the 'align' parameter is enclosed in braces, e.g.,
     'w{l}{3cm}'.  The short version 'wl{3cm}' is not supported.

   * Entries for 'PDF Tools' are added in
     'TeX-view-program-list-builtin' for Windows and macOS. This viewer
     can be configured under these operating systems with an entry like
     this in an init file:
          (setq TeX-view-program-selection '((output-pdf "PDF Tools")))

   * Several other bugs were fixed, many minor features were added.

News in 12.1
============

   * AUCTeX now requires GNU Emacs 24 or higher.  Support for XEmacs has
     been dropped.

   * Besides the change in the supported version of Emacs, there has
     been no functional change in this release, which is equivalent to
     version 11.92.

News in 11.92
=============

   * preview-latex is compatible with Ghostscript 9.22 where the
     operator '.runandhide' is removed.  All occurrences of
     '.runandhide' in preview-latex are replaced by alternative code
     making it work with Ghostscript 9.22 again.

   * AUCTeX has a new customize option
     'TeX-math-input-method-off-regexp'.  When you begin to input a math
     formula, the current input method is turned off if its name matches
     this regular expression.

     In fact this variable was introduced long before, but has not been
     documented in info files nor turned into a customize option with
     'defcustom' until this release.

   * The window system focus is pulled back to Emacs when viewing with
     evince-compatible viewers if a new customize option
     'TeX-view-evince-keep-focus' is non-nil.

   * The usual dose of bug fixes was administered.

News in 11.91
=============

   * Now AUCTeX has a logo.  The LaTeX code to create it is available in
     the 'etc/' directory of the package.

   * Add support for 'upmendex', an extension of 'makeindex' capable of
     sorting indexes by unicode based ICU.

   * Fix preview-latex to interact correctly with Japanese LaTeX.  The
     parsing routine was made robust not to be confused by the 7-bit
     encoding of Japanese text and the necessary option to LaTeX command
     is kept even when preamble caching is enabled.

   * The new "Glossaries" entry in 'TeX-command-list' runs the command
     'makeglossaries'.

   * Fontification of control symbols has been improved.  Characters
     defined in 'font-latex-match-simple-exclude-list' do not receive
     any fontification.  In DocTeX mode, the character '_' is removed
     from 'font-latex-match-simple-exclude-list' in order to fontify
     macros like '\__module_foo:nnn' correctly.

   * Fontification of math environments has been improved.  Optional
     and/or mandatory argument(s) to environments are not fontified.

   * 'preview.sty' loads 'luatex85.sty' if possible and should be
     compatible with newer luaTeX versions.

   * AUCTeX has a new customize option 'TeX-ispell-verb-delimiters'.
     This string contains usual characters used as delimiters for
     in-line verbatim macros like '\verb'.  Text between delimiters
     after an in-line verbatim macro will be skipped during spell
     checking.

   * Fontification of in-line verbatim macros has been improved.
     'font-latex.el' recognizes an optional or a mandatory argument for
     macros like '\Verb' from 'fancyvrb.sty', '\mint' and '\mintinline'
     from 'minted.sty' and fontifies verbatim content correctly.

   * AUCTeX can put and parse labels in optional argument of
     environments.  Inserting labels is done by new function
     'LaTeX-env-label-as-keyval'.  A new customize option
     'LaTeX-listing-label' is available as prefix to labels in code
     typesetting environments, e.g.  'lstlisting' environment provided
     by 'listings' package.  'LaTeX-listing-label' defaults to 'lst:'.
     Parsing of labels for later referencing relies on two requirements:
       1. Label should come as last key-value argument, and
       2. label must be enclosed in braces, e.g.
               \begin{lstlisting}[caption=Some Caption,label={lst:foo}]
               ...
               \end{lstlisting}

   * The function 'LaTeX-label' now takes a second optional argument
     'NO-INSERT'.  When non-'nil', 'LaTeX-label' reads a label and
     returns it as a string.  This argument is also passed to any
     function bound to 'LaTeX-label-function' (see next item).

   * *Incompatible change:* The signature for the function passed with
     the customize option 'LaTeX-label-function' has changed.  The
     function bound to this variable is now expected to take an optional
     second argument 'NO-INSERT'.  When this argument is non-'nil', the
     function should read and only return a label as a string; insertion
     is done by another function.

   * Directory local variables were ineffective for
     'japanese-latex-mode' and 'japanese-plain-tex-mode'.  This bug was
     fixed.  (This was actually done in AUCTeX 11.90, but not
     advertised)

   * The output of Japanese text from Japanese TeX engines is decoded
     correctly for most cases, according to the encoding of the TeX
     documents and the locale.  The difference between MS Windows, macOS
     and unix-like OS is taken into account.  (This was actually done in
     AUCTeX 11.90, but not advertised)

   * Quite a few new LaTeX packages are supported.

   * As usual, many bugs were fixed.

News in 11.90
=============

   * In addition to the completion performed by 'TeX-complete-symbol',
     AUCTeX now also supports the new Emacs standard completion-at-point
     facility (see the Emacs command 'completion-at-point').  This also
     means that modern completion UIs like company-mode work out of the
     box in TeX and LaTeX buffers.

   * Completion is now aware of being inside a math environment and then
     completes math macros.

   * AUCTeX is able to display several levels of super- and subscripts,
     each one raised above and a bit smaller than its basis.  For this
     feature, have a look at the customize options
     'font-latex-fontify-script' (especially the new values
     'multi-level' and 'invisible') and
     'font-latex-fontify-script-max-level'.  Also, the script characters
     '^' and '_' are also fontified with a special face named
     'font-latex-script-char-face'.

   * Parsing of format specification in various tabular environments has
     been improved.  The function 'LaTeX-insert-item' ('C-c <LFD>')
     inserts suitable number of ampersands for '*{num}{cols}'
     constructs.  Style files for LaTeX packages 'tabularx', 'tabulary',
     'longtable', 'dcolumn' and 'siunitx' are adapted to take advantage
     of this improvement.

   * AUCTeX has a new Ispell dictionary 'tex-ispell.el' for macros and
     environments which will be skipped during spell checking.  The
     activiation of this feature is controlled by a new customize option
     'TeX-ispell-extend-skip-list', which is set to 't' and activated by
     default.

   * AUCTeX has a new customize option 'TeX-raise-frame-function' that
     is currently only used by Evince and Atril inverse search to raise
     the Emacs frame.

   * When inserting a new float, AUCTeX will now prompt for a
     short-caption if the length of the caption provided is greater than
     a certain size.  This size is controlled via a new user option
     'LaTeX-short-caption-prompt-length'.

   * Parsing of the compilation log has been reworked.  You should
     encounter fewer mistaken files while navigating through errors and
     warnings.

   * Two new user options, 'TeX-ignore-warnings' and
     'TeX-suppress-ignored-warnings', allow ignoring certain warnings
     after compilation of the document.

   * A new option, 'TeX-PDF-from-DVI', controls if and how to produce a
     PDF file by converting a DVI file.  This supersedes
     'TeX-PDF-via-dvips-ps2pdf' which is still recognized but marked as
     obsolete and may be removed in future releases.

   * Support for a number of external viewers has been added:
        * Atril viewer.  Forward and inverse search requires version
          1.9.1 or later to work.

        * dviout viewer on Windows.  Note that this setup works when
          'TeX-source-correlate-method' is set to use 'source-specials'
          for DVI, e.g.:
               (setq TeX-source-correlate-method
                     '((dvi . source-specials)
                       (pdf . synctex)))
          which is the default.

        * SumatraPDF viewer on Windows.

        * Zathura viewer.  Forward and inverse search requires a recent
          version of the program to work (3.4 or later).

   * A new function, 'TeX-documentation-texdoc', for reading
     documentation with 'texdoc' has been added.  'TeX-doc' is still
     available but now 'C-c ?' runs 'TeX-documentation-texdoc'.

   * AUCTeX has a new custom option
     'LaTeX-reftex-cite-format-auto-activate' which controls the
     automatic activation of citation formats provided by RefTeX when a
     style file is loaded and RefTeX is enabled.  Currently,
     'biblatex.el', 'harvard.el', 'jurabib.el' and 'natbib.el' use this
     feature.  If you have customized 'reftex-cite-format' and want to
     use your settings, you should set this variable to 'nil'.

   * AUCTeX now has limited support for the TikZ package.  For the
     moment, this includes some basic support for prompting the user of
     arguments to the '\draw' macro.

   * The style 'graphicx.el' went through a bigger overhaul.  The
     optional argument of command '\includegraphics' now supports
     key-val query; keys can independently be chosen anytime by pressing
     the <,> key.  As a side effect, the variable
     'LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist' is now no-op and is removed
     from 'tex-style.el'.  You can safely remove any customization of it
     from your init file.  The mandatory argument of '\includegraphics'
     knows about image file extensions supported by the used engine and
     offers them for inclusion.

   * Support for other LaTeX packages was improved, and style files for
     several new packages were added.

   * Many bugs were crushed along the way.

News in 11.89
=============

   * You can now run all commands needed to compile a document and then
     open the viewer with a single command: 'TeX-command-run-all', bound
     to 'C-c C-a'.

   * Commands such as LaTeX and View can now be executed conveniently on
     the current section (or part, chapter, subsection, etc).  See
     'LaTeX-command-section' and 'LaTeX-command-section-change-level'.

   * Forward and backward search with Evince now also work when only a
     region of the document is compiled/viewed.

   * To open the PDF output file you can now use also PDF Tools, a
     document viewer for Emacs.  With it, as a plus, forward and
     backward search is accurate at word level.

   * With new option 'TeX-PDF-via-dvips-ps2pdf' it is possible to
     compile a document to DVI and then convert it to PDF using
     'dvips'-'ps2pdf' before viewing it.

   * New option 'TeX-file-line-error' allows to select file:line:error
     style for error messages.

   * Indent '\[...\]' math mode as a regular environment by default.

   * Now AUCTeX suggests to run 'makeindex' when appropriate.

   * 'TeX-view-program-list' can contain, as third optional element of
     each item, the name of the executable(s) needed to open the viewer.

   * 'TeX-expand-list' variable has been split into 'TeX-expand-list'
     and 'TeX-expand-list-builtin'.  Only the former is intended to be
     customized by the user, the latter contains built-in expanders.
     You might want to keep in 'TeX-expand-list' only new expansion
     strings.

   * Before running commands like TeX and LaTeX, now AUCTeX performs
     some checks.  If 'TeX-check-TeX' is non-nil, it will test whether a
     working TeX distribution is actually present in the system and
     available to Emacs.  Instead, when 'TeX-check-engine' is non-nil,
     before running LaTeX commands AUCTeX will check whether the correct
     engine has been set, based upon known restrictions posed by LaTeX
     packages.

   * Basic support to ConTeXt Mark IV has been added.  Users can now
     select the Mark version to be used with new option
     'ConTeXt-Mark-version', and AUCTeX is able to catch error messages
     in the output log of a Mark IV document.

   * Support for tons of LaTeX packages has been added.

   * Numbers of bugs have been fixed, many minor features have been
     added.

News in 11.88
=============

   * 'TeX-PDF-mode' is now enabled by default.

   * Now 'TeX-previous-error' works with TeX commands if the new option
     'TeX-parse-all-errors' is non-nil, which is the default.  When this
     option is non-nil, an overview of errors and warnings reported by
     the TeX compiler can be opened with 'M-x TeX-error-overview <RET>'.

   * Style file authors are encouraged to distinguish common from expert
     macros and environments, and mark the latter using
     'TeX-declare-expert-macros' and
     'LaTeX-declare-expert-environments'.

     Users can then restrict completion using
     'TeX-complete-expert-commands'.

   * Management of LaTeX package options in the parser was improved.
     You might need to reparse your documents, especially if you loaded
     the 'babel' package with language options.

   * Now you can insert '$...$' or '\(...\)' by typing a single '$'.  To
     do this, customize the new option 'TeX-electric-math'.
     'TeX-math-close-double-dollar' was removed.

   * 'C-c <RET> documentclass <RET>' completes with all available LaTeX
     classes, if the 'TeX-arg-input-file-search' variable is non-nil.
     Completion for class options of the standard LaTeX classes is
     provided as well.

   * New user options 'LaTeX-default-author',
     'LaTeX-fontspec-arg-font-search',
     'LaTeX-fontspec-font-list-default', 'TeX-date-format', and
     'TeX-insert-braces-alist'.  A new possible value
     ('show-all-optional-args') for 'TeX-insert-macro-default-style' was
     added.  The default value of 'TeX-source-correlate-method' has been
     changed.

   * 'biblatex' support was greatly expanded.  If parsing is enabled,
     AUCTeX looks at 'backend' option to decide whether to use Biber or
     BibTeX. The 'LaTeX-biblatex-use-Biber' variable was changed to be
     file local only and is no more customizable.

   * With some LaTeX classes, the default environment suggested by
     'LaTeX-environment' ('C-c C-e') when the current environment is
     'document' was changed.  With 'beamer' class the default
     environment is 'frame', with 'letter' it is 'letter', with 'slides'
     it is 'slide'.

   * Brace pairing feature was enhanced in LaTeX documents.  Support for
     '\bigl', '\Bigl', '\biggl' and '\Biggl', the same as the one for
     '\left', was added to 'TeX-insert-macro'.  For example, 'C-c <RET>
     bigl <RET> ( <RET>' inserts '\bigl(\bigr)'.

     You can insert brace pair '()', '{}' and '[]' by typing a single
     left brace if the new user option 'LaTeX-electric-left-right-brace'
     is enabled.

     Macros '\langle', '\lfloor' and '\lceil', which produce the left
     part of the paired braces, are treated similarly as '(', '{' and
     '[' during the course of 'TeX-insert-macro'.

   * Support for dozens of LaTeX packages was added.

   * Tabular-like environments (tabular, tabular*, tabularx, tabulary,
     array, align, ...)  are indented in a nicer and more informative
     way when the column values of a table line are written across
     multiple lines in the tex file.

   * The suitable number of ampersands are inserted when you insert
     array, tabular and tabular* environments with 'C-c C-e'.  Similar
     experience is obtained if you terminate rows in these environments
     with 'C-c <LFD>'.  It supplies line break macro '\\' and inserts
     the suitable number of ampersands on the next line.

     Similar supports are provided for various amsmath environments.

   * Commands for narrowing to a group ('TeX-narrow-to-group') and to
     LaTeX environments ('LaTeX-narrow-to-environment') were added.

   * Now arbitrary options can be passed to the TeX processor on a per
     file basis using the 'TeX-command-extra-options' option.

   * Now 'C-c C-e document <RET>', in an empty document, prompts for
     '\usepackage' macros in addition to '\documentclass'.

   * 'TeX-add-style-hook' has now a third argument to tell AUCTeX for
     which dialect (LaTeX, Texinfo or BibTeX) the style hook is
     registers.  Labelling style hook by dialect will avoid applying
     them not in the right context.

   * There have been lots of bug fixes and feature additions.

News in 11.87
=============

   * AUCTeX now supports Biber in conjunction with biblatex in addition
     to BibTeX.

   * Each AUCTeX mode now has its own abbrev table.  On Emacsen which
     provide the possibility to inherit abbrevs from other tables, the
     abbrevs from the Text mode abbrev table are available as well.
     Newly defined abbrevs are written to the mode-specific tables,
     though.

   * The file 'tex-fptex.el' was removed.

   * Forward/backward search for Evince has been improved.  If Emacs is
     compiled with DBUS support and a recent Evince version (3.x) is
     installed, the communication goes over the desktop bus instead of
     the command line, resulting in more accurate positioning of point
     in Emacs and highlighting of the target paragraph in Evince.

   * A problem where Ghostscript threw an /invalidfileaccess error when
     running preview-latex was fixed.

   * A lot of smaller fixes and additions have been made.

News in 11.86
=============

   * Parsing of LaTeX output was improved.  It is now less likely that
     AUCTeX opens a non-existent file upon calling 'TeX-next-error'; a
     problem for example encountered when using MiKTeX 2.8.  In addition
     quoted file names as emitted by MiKTeX are now supported.

   * A new framework for the definition and selection of viewers was
     implemented.  If you have customizations regarding viewers you will
     have to redo them in this new framework or reenable the old one.
     See the section on viewers in the manual for details.

   * Comprehensive editing support for PSTricks was added.

   * Support for various LaTeX packages was added, e.g.  'tabularx',
     'CJK', and 'hyperref'.

   * An easy way to switch between TeX engines (PDFTeX, LuaTeX, XeTeX,
     Omega) was added.

   * Support for SyncTeX was added.  This involves the command line
     options for LaTeX and the viewer.

   * Folding can now be customized to use macro arguments as replacement
     text.

   * 'preview.sty' now works with XeTeX.

   * A lot of smaller and larger bugs have been squashed.

News in 11.85
=============

   * Font locking has been improved significantly.  It is now less prone
     to color bleeding which could lead to high resource usage.  In
     addition it now includes information about LaTeX macro syntax and
     can indicate syntactically incorrect macros in LaTeX mode.

   * The license was updated to GPLv3.

   * Support for the nomencl, flashcards and comment LaTeX packages as
     well as the Icelandic language option of babel were added.

   * Support for folding of math macros was added.

   * Lots of minor bugs in features and documentation fixed.

News in 11.84
=============

   * There have been problems with the '-without-texmf-dir' option to
     'configure' when the value of '-with-kpathsea-sep' was set or
     determined for an installation system with a default different from
     that of the runtime system.  'with-kpathsea-sep' has been removed;
     the setting is now usually determined at runtime.

     Due to this and other problems, preview-latex in the released
     XEmacs package failed under Windows or with anything except recent
     21.5 XEmacsen.

   * AUCTeX and preview-latex have been changed in order to accommodate
     file names containing spaces.  preview-latex now tolerates bad
     PostScript code polluting the stack (like some Omega fonts).

   * 'preview.sty' had in some cases failed to emit PostScript header
     specials.

   * Support for folding of comments was added.

   * The 'polish' language option of the babel LaTeX package as well as
     the polski LaTeX package are now supported.  Most notably this
     means that AUCTeX will help to insert quotation marks as defined by
     polish.sty ('"`..."'') and polski.sty (',,...''').

   * The TeX tool bar is now available and enabled by default in plain
     TeX mode.

   * Bug fix in the display of math subscripts and superscripts.

   * Bug fix 'TeX-doc' for Emacs 21.

   * There has been quite a number of other bug fixes to various
     features and documentation across the board.

News in 11.83
=============

   * The new function 'TeX-doc' provides easy access to documentation
     about commands and packages or information related to TeX and
     friends in general.  It is accessible with the key binding 'C-c ?'
     or the 'Find Documentation...' entry in the mode menus.

   * You can now get rid of generated intermediate and output files by
     means of the new 'Clean' and 'Clean All' entries in
     'TeX-command-list' accessible with 'C-c C-c' or the Command menu.

   * Support for forward search with PDF files was added.  That means
     you can jump to a place in the output file corresponding to the
     position in the source file.  Currently this only works if you use
     the pdfsync LaTeX package and xpdf as your PDF viewer.  The
     accuracy is in the range of +/-1 page.

     Adding support for this feature required the default value of the
     variable 'TeX-output-view-style' to be changed.  Please make sure
     you either remove any customizations overriding the new default or
     incorporate the changes into your customizations if you want to use
     this feature.

   * TeX error messages of the '-file-line-error' kind are now
     understood in AUCTeX and preview-latex (parsers are still
     separate).

   * Bug fix in XyMTeX support.

   * The LaTeX tool bar is now enabled by default.

News in 11.82
=============

   * Support for the MinionPro LaTeX package was added.

   * Warnings and underfull/overfull boxes are now being indicated in
     the echo area after a LaTeX run, if the respective debugging
     options are activated with 'TeX-toggle-debug-warnings' ('C-c C-t
     C-w') or 'TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes' ('C-c C-t C-b').  In this
     case 'TeX-next-error' will find these warnings in addition to
     normal errors.

     The key binding 'C-c C-w' for 'TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes' (which
     was renamed from 'TeX-toggle-debug-boxes') now is deprecated.

   * AUCTeX now can automatically insert a pair of braces after typing
     <_> or <^> in math constructs if the new variable
     'TeX-electric-sub-and-superscript' is set to a non-nil value.

   * Some language-specific support for French was added.  There now is
     completion support for the commands provided by the 'frenchb' (and
     'francais') options of the babel LaTeX package and easier input of
     French quotation marks ('\\og ...\\fg') which can now be inserted
     by typing <">.

   * Completion support for options of some LaTeX packages was added.

   * Already in version 11.81 the way to activate AUCTeX changed
     substantially.  This should now be done with '(load "auctex.el" nil
     t t)' instead of the former '(require 'tex-site)'.  Related to this
     change 'tex-mik.el' does not load 'tex-site.el' anymore.  That
     means if you used only '(require 'tex-mik)' in order to activate
     AUCTeX, you have to add '(load "auctex.el" nil t t)' before the
     latter statement.  More detailed information can be found in the
     installation instructions (file INSTALL).

   * Handling of verbatim constructs was consolidated across AUCTeX.
     This resulted in the font-latex-specific variables
     'font-latex-verb-like-commands', 'font-latex-verbatim-macros', and
     'font-latex-verbatim-environments' being removed and the more
     general variables 'LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-delims',
     'LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-braces', and
     'LaTeX-verbatim-environments' being added.

   * The output of a BibTeX run is now checked for warnings and errors,
     which are reported in the echo area.

   * The aliases for 'font-latex-title-fontify' were removed.  Use
     'font-latex-fontify-sectioning' instead.

   * The problem that Japanese macros where broken across lines was
     fixed.

   * Various bug fixes.

News in 11.81
=============

   * 'LaTeX-mark-section' now marks subsections of a given section as
     well.  The former behavior is available via the prefix argument.

   * preview-latex which was previously available separately became a
     subsystem of AUCTeX.  There is no documented provision for building
     or installing preview-latex separately.  It is still possible to
     use and install AUCTeX without preview-latex, however.

   * The installation procedures have been overhauled and now also
     install startup files as part of the process (those had to be
     copied manually previously).  You are advised to remove previous
     installations of AUCTeX and preview-latex before starting the
     installation procedure.  A standard installation from an unmodified
     tarball no longer requires Makeinfo or Perl.

     Also note that the way AUCTeX is supposed to be activated changed.
     Instead of '(require 'tex-site)' you should now use '(load
     "auctex.el" nil t t)'.  While the former method may still work, the
     new method has the advantage that you can deactivate a preactivated
     AUCTeX with the statement '(unload-feature 'tex-site)' before any
     of its modes have been used.  This may be important especially for
     site-wide installations.

   * Support for the babel LaTeX package was added.

   * Folding a buffer now ensures that the whole buffer is fontified
     before the actual folding is carried out.  If this results in
     unbearably long execution times, you can fall back to the old
     behavior of relying on stealth font locking to do this job in the
     background by customizing the variable 'TeX-fold-force-fontify'.

   * Folded content now reveals part of its original text in a tooltip
     or the echo area when hovering with the mouse pointer over it.

   * The language-specific insertion of quotation marks was generalized.
     The variables 'LaTeX-german-open-quote',
     'LaTeX-german-close-quote', 'LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote',
     'LaTeX-italian-open-quote', 'LaTeX-italian-close-quote', and
     'LaTeX-italian-quote-after-quote' are now obsolete.  If you are not
     satisfied with the default settings, you should customize
     'TeX-quote-language-alist' instead.

   * Similar to language-specific quote insertion, AUCTeX now helps you
     with hyphens in different languages as well.

   * Fill problems in Japanese text introduced in AUCTeX 11.55 were
     fixed.  AUCTeX tries not to break lines between 1-byte and 2-byte
     chars.  These features will work in Chinese text, too.

   * The scaling factor of the fontification of sectioning commands can
     now be customized using the variable
     'font-latex-fontify-sectioning'.  This variable was previously
     called 'font-latex-title-fontify'; In this release we provide an
     alias but this will disappear in one of the the next releases.  The
     faces for the sectioning commands are now called
     'font-latex-sectioning-N-face' (N=0...5) instead of
     'font-latex-title-N-face' (N=1...4).  Analogously the names of the
     variables holding the related keyword lists were changed from
     'font-latex-title-N-keywords' to
     'font-latex-sectioning-N-keywords'.  Make sure to adjust your
     customizations.

   * Titles in beamer slides marked by the "\frametitle" command are
     know displayed with the new face 'font-latex-slide-title-face'.
     You can add macros to be highlighted with this face to
     'font-latex-match-slide-title-keywords'.

   * Of course a lot of bugs have been fixed.

News in 11.55
=============

   * A bug was fixed which lead to the insertion of trailing whitespace
     during filling.  In particular extra spaces were added to sentence
     endings at the end of lines.  You can make this whitespace visible
     by setting the variable 'show-trailing-whitespace' to 't'.  If you
     want to delete all trailing whitespace in a buffer, type 'M-x
     delete-trailing-whitespace RET'.

   * A bug was fixed which lead to a '*Compile-Log*' buffer popping up
     when the first LaTeX file was loaded in an Emacs session.

   * On some systems the presence of an outdated Emacspeak package lead
     to the error message 'File mode specification error: (error
     "Variable binding depth exceeds max-specpdl-size")'.  Precautions
     were added which prevent this error from happening.  But
     nevertheless, it is advised to upgrade or uninstall the outdated
     Emacspeak package.

   * The value of 'TeX-macro-global' is not determined during
     configuration anymore but at load time of AUCTeX.  Consequently the
     associated configuration option '--with-tex-input-dirs' was
     removed.

   * Support for the LaTeX Japanese classes 'jsarticle' and 'jsbook' was
     added.

News in 11.54
=============

   * The parser (used e.g.  for 'TeX-auto-generate-global') was extended
     to recognize keywords common in LaTeX packages and classes, like
     "\DeclareRobustCommand" or "\RequirePackage".  Additionally a bug
     was fixed which led to duplicate entries in AUCTeX style files.

   * Folding can now be done for paragraphs and regions besides single
     constructs and the whole buffer.  With the new 'TeX-fold-dwim'
     command content can both be hidden and shown with a single key
     binding.  In course of these changes new key bindings for unfolding
     commands where introduced.  The old bindings are still present but
     will be phased out in future releases.

   * Info files of the manual now have a .info extension.

   * There is an experimental tool bar support now.  It is not activated
     by default.  If you want to use it, add
          (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'LaTeX-install-toolbar)
     to your init file.

   * The manual now contains a new chapter "Quick Start".  It explains
     the main features and how to use them, and should be enough for a
     new user to start using AUCTeX.

   * A new section "Font Locking" was added to the manual which explains
     syntax highlighting in AUCTeX and its customization.  Together with
     the sections related to folding and outlining, the section is part
     of the new chapter "Display".

   * Keywords for syntax highlighting of LaTeX constructs to be typeset
     in bold, italic or typewriter fonts may now be customized.  Besides
     the built-in classes, new keyword classes may be added by
     customizing the variable 'font-latex-user-keyword-classes'.  The
     customization options can be found in the customization group
     'font-latex-keywords'.

   * Verbatim content is now displayed with the 'fixed-pitch' face.
     (GNU Emacs only)

   * Syntax highlighting should not spill out of verbatim content
     anymore.  (GNU Emacs only)

   * Verbatim commands like '\verb|...|' will not be broken anymore
     during filling.

   * You can customize the completion for graphic files with
     'LaTeX-includegraphics-read-file'.

   * Support for the LaTeX packages 'url', 'listings', 'jurabib' and
     'csquotes' was added with regard to command completion and syntax
     highlighting.

   * Performance of fontification and filling was improved.

   * Insertion of nodes in Texinfo mode now supports completion of
     existing node names.

   * Setting the variable 'LaTeX-float' to 'nil' now means that you will
     not be prompted for the float position of figures and tables.  You
     can get the old behaviour of 'nil' by setting the variable to '""',
     i.e.  an empty string.

   * The XEmacs-specific bug concerning 'overlays-at' was fixed.

   * Lots of bug fixes.

News in 11.53
=============

   * The LaTeX math menu can include Unicode characters if your Emacs
     built supports it.  See the variable 'LaTeX-math-menu-unicode'.

   * Bug fixes for XEmacs.

   * Completion for graphic files in the TeX search path has been added.

   * 'start' is used for the viewer for MiKTeX and fpTeX.

   * The variable 'TeX-fold-preserve-comments' can now be customized to
     deactivate folding in comments.

News in 11.52
=============

   * Installation and menus under XEmacs work again (maybe for the first
     time).

   * Fontification of subscripts and superscripts is now disabled when
     the fontification engine is not able to support it properly.

   * Bug fixes in the build process.

News in 11.51
=============

   * PDFTeX and Source Special support did not work with ConTeXt, this
     has been fixed.  Similar for Source Special support under Windows.

   * Omega support has been added.

   * Bug fixes in the build process.

   * 'TeX-fold' now supports folding of environments in Texinfo mode.

News in 11.50
=============

   * The use of source specials when processing or viewing the document
     can now be controlled with the new 'TeX-source-specials' minor mode
     which can be toggled via an entry in the Command menu or the key
     binding 'C-c C-t C-s'.  If you have customized the variable
     'TeX-command-list', you have to re-initialize it for this to work.
     This means to open a customization buffer for the variable by
     typing 'M-x customize-variable RET TeX-command-list RET', selecting
     "Erase Customization" and do your customization again with the new
     default.

   * The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain TeX,
     LaTeX, ConTeXt etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
     'TeX-command-list' has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
     and the customization will not work correctly.

   * Support for hiding and auto-revealing macros, e.g.  footnotes or
     citations, and environments in a buffer was added.

   * You can now control if indentation is done upon typing <RET> by
     customizing the variable 'TeX-newline-function'.

   * Limited support for 'doc.sty' and 'ltxdoc.cls' ('dtx' files) was
     added.  The new docTeX mode provides functionality for editing
     documentation parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and
     filling), adding and completion of macros and environments while
     staying in comments as well as syntax highlighting.  (Please note
     that the mode is not finished yet.  For example syntax highlighting
     does not work yet in XEmacs.)

   * For macro completion in docTeX mode the AUCTeX style files
     'doc.el', 'ltxdoc.el' and 'ltx-base.el' were included.  The latter
     provides general support for low-level LaTeX macros and may be used
     with LaTeX class and style files as well.  It is currently not
     loaded automatically for those files.

   * Support for ConTeXt with a separate ConTeXt mode is now included.
     Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and
     English.

   * The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
     format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
     available functionality and customization options are explained in
     the manual.

   * Filling and indentation in XEmacs with preview-latex and activated
     previews lead to the insertion of whitespace before multi-line
     previews.  AUCTeX now contains facilities to prevent this problem.

   * If 'TeX-master' is set to 't', AUCTeX will now query for a master
     file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
     alone.  The new function 'TeX-master-file-ask' (bound to 'C-c _' is
     provided for adding the variable manually.

   * Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display
     devices which support such fontification.  The variable
     'font-latex-title-fontify' can be customized to restore the old
     appearance, i.e.  the usage of a different color instead of a
     change in size.

   * Support for 'alphanum.sty', 'beamer.cls', 'booktabs.sty',
     'captcont.sty', 'emp.sty', 'paralist.sty', 'subfigure.sty' and
     'units.sty'/'nicefrac.sty' was added.  Credits go to the authors
     mentioned in the respective AUCTeX style files.

   * Inserting graphics with 'C-c RET \includegraphics RET' was
     improved.  See the variable 'LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist'.

   * If 'LaTeX-default-position' is 'nil', don't prompt for position
     arguments in Tabular-like environments.

   * Completion for available packages when using 'C-c RET \usepackage
     RET' was improved on systems using the kpathsea library.

   * The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
     commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for
     paragraphs and regions respectively which do both.

   * Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited
     by either >>German<< or <<French>> quotation marks by changing the
     variable 'font-latex-quotes'.

   * Certain TeX/LaTeX keywords for functions, references, variables and
     warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
     keywords by customizing the variables
     'font-latex-match-function-keywords',
     'font-latex-match-reference-keywords',
     'font-latex-match-variable-keywords' and
     'font-latex-match-warning-keywords'.

   * If you include the style files 'german' or 'ngerman' in a document
     (directly or via the 'babel' package), you should now customize
     'LaTeX-german-open-quote', 'LaTeX-german-close-quote' and
     'LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote' instead of 'TeX-open-quote',
     'TeX-close-quote' and 'TeX-quote-after-quote' if you want to
     influence the type of quote insertion.

   * Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line
     options for it are now determined automatically by looking at the
     extension of the output file and certain options used in the source
     file.  The behavior can be adapted or extended respectively by
     customizing the variable 'TeX-output-view-style'.

   * You can control whether 'TeX-insert-macro' ('C-c RET') ask for all
     optional arguments by customizing the variable
     'TeX-insert-macro-default-style'.

   * 'TeX-run-discard' is now able to completely detach a process that
     it started.

   * The build process was enhanced and is now based on 'autoconf'
     making installing AUCTeX a mostly automatic process.  See the files
     'INSTALL' and 'INSTALL.windows' for details.
