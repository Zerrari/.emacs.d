* indent-guide.el

インデントを縦線で表示

show vertical lines to guide indentation

** Screencast

Current block only

[[screencast.gif]]

All blocks

** Usage

Require this script

: (require 'indent-guide)

and call command =M-x indent-guide-mode=.

If you want to enable =indent-guide-mode= in all buffers, call
function =indent-guide-global-mode=.

: (indent-guide-global-mode)

** Configuration

Column lines are propertized with =indent-guide-face=. So you may
configure this face to make lines more pretty in your colorscheme.

: (set-face-background 'indent-guide-face "dimgray")

If you want indent-guide to show guide lines only in idle-time, you
can set delay.

: (setq indent-guide-delay 0.1)

You may also change the character for guides.

: (setq indent-guide-char ":")

NOT RECOMMENDED: To show not only one guide line but all guide lines
recursively, set =indent-guide-recursive= non-nil.

: (setq indent-guide-recursive t)

=indent-guide-recursive= seems buggy and laggy, so I recommend
the =highlight-indentation= package for that purpose.

** Comparisons with highlight-indentation

- look and feel

- better block detection in LISP-like languages

  : (foo                  (foo
  : |(foobar baz          |(foobar baz
  : ||       (foobar      |   |   |(foobar
  : ||       |(qux))))    |   |   | (qux))))
  :
  :    indent-guide     highlight-indentation

- supports TABs

- worse in performance, especially when you open a file that includes
  very large, deep blocks

** Known Limitations

does not work perfectly with following modes (commands) :

- =company-mode=, =auto-complete-mode=, =popup.el= (tooltips may not rendered perfectly)
- =pager.el= (guide lines are not rendered immediately, after =pager-up/down=)
